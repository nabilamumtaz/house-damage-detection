# üè† House Damage Detection System

A web-based application designed to detect and classify house damage levels using AI technology. The system analyzes uploaded images and categorizes them into three distinct levels: **severe damage**, **moderate damage**, and **minor damage**. Built with **Streamlit**, this platform offers accurate damage classification to assist users in evaluating building conditions.

  - **Minor Damage**: Small cracks or cosmetic issues.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Upload images and receive results easily.

- **Interactive Data Visualization**  
  View detection history and statistics.

- **Database Integration**  
  Stores user accounts and detection results in a **MySQL database**.

- **API Integration**  
  Accessible API endpoints, testable via **Postman**.

### API Endpoints (Tested with Postman)

- **`GET /`**: Returns a welcome message.
- **`POST /register`**: Registers a new user.
  ```json
  {
    "email": "example@gmail.com",
    "password": "yourpassword"
  }
  ```
- **`POST /login`**: Authenticates a user.
- **`POST /predict`**: Upload an image for damage classification.
  ```json
  {
    "label": "Severe Damage",

## üîß Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nabilamumtaz/house-damage-detection.git
   ```

2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Import the database structure:
   - The **MySQL database** consists of two tables:
     - **`users`**: Contains user account details.
       - **Columns**:
         - `id`: Unique identifier for each user (Primary Key).
         - `email`: User's email address (must be unique).
         - `password`: Hashed password for secure authentication.
     - **`detections`**: Stores detection history.
       - **Columns**:
         - `id`: Unique identifier for each detection record (Primary Key).
         - `email`: Email of the user associated with the detection.
         - `label`: Classification result (`Severe Damage`, `Moderate Damage`, or `Minor Damage`).
         - `confidence`: AI model's confidence percentage in the classification.
         - `timestamp`: Date and time when the detection was made.

4. Start the API:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Run the Streamlit app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
