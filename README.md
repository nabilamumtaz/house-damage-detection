# 🏠 House Damage Detection System

A web-based application designed to detect and classify house damage levels using AI technology. The system analyzes uploaded images and categorizes them into three distinct levels: **severe damage**, **moderate damage**, and **minor damage**. Built with **Streamlit**, this platform offers accurate damage classification to assist users in evaluating building conditions.

***

## 📋 Features

- **Accurate Damage Classification**  
  Utilizes AI to classify house damages into:  
  - **Severe Damage**: Total structural failure.  
  - **Moderate Damage**: Significant damage requiring major repairs.  
  - **Minor Damage**: Small cracks or cosmetic issues.  

- **User-Friendly Interface**  
  Upload images and receive results quickly and easily.

- **Interactive Data Visualization**  
  View detection history and statistics with interactive charts.

***

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Deep Learning Framework**: Built with **MobileNetV2** architecture for image classification.  
- **Frontend Framework**: Developed using **Streamlit** for an intuitive user experience.  
- **Visualization Tools**: Interactive graphs powered by **Plotly**.  
- **Backend Framework**: **TensorFlow/Keras** for AI model implementation.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. **Upload an Image**  
   Upload a picture of a house through the web interface.

2. **Get the Results**  
   The system will classify the image into one of the three categories:  
   - **Severe Damage**  
   - **Moderate Damage**  
   - **Minor Damage**

3. **View Statistics**  
   Explore interactive charts to analyze detection results.
